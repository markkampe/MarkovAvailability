# Markov Availability Model
#   sample model - car tires and spare

# processing this file:
#	to draw the graph

#
# format of this file:
#   This file is in the graphviz dot (directed graph) language.
#   The most interesting lines describe nodes and edges.
#	node [attributes]; 
#	    names nodes with those attributes
#		attribute: shape
#		attribute: color
#	nodename -> nodename [attributes];
#		attribute: label
#
#   additional node properties for Markov models:
#       state = <string>        avaialibility class (e.g. up/down)
#
#   additional edge properties for Markov models:
#       fits = <number>         FIT rate
#       rate = <number>         FIT rate
#       time = <number><unit>   interval
#   		time unit suffixes
#       	    y ...   years
#       	    w ...   weeks
#       	    d ...   days
#       	    h ...   hours
#       	    m ...   minutes
#       	    s ...   seconds
#
# NOTE:
#   these examples exercise multiple rate syntaxes
#   if no time/rate is specified, the value is to be found in an
#   external dictionary
